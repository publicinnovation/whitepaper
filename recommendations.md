The purpose of this paper has been to provide context for, and recommend the adoption of, a shared agenda for regional civic innovation in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area. The recommendations listed below fall into two categories (1) *core recommendations* to set the vision and structure for civic innovation to flourish, and (2) a set of *future considerations* that may accelerate the growth of our regional civic innovation ecosystem.

### Core Recommendations

1. The region's local government bodies should adopt a resolution in support of a regional agenda modeled after the Draft Regional Civic Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Agenda in [Appendix A](/resolution).

2. The region should establish a multi-sector stakeholder advisory body to advise the region's local, state, and federal agencies on open data and civic innovation. The advisory body should:

	a. Consist of local government staff, leaders of civic organizations, representatives from academia, and members of the entrepreneurship community;

	b. Be charged with coordinating open data initiatives and developing civic data standards to support interoperability across all levels of government;

	c. Develop and adopt a one-year action plan for the purposes of achieving quick and early wins;

	d. Identify areas in which state statute or regulations inhibit civic innovation; and,

	e. Identify ways in which civic startups and social enterprises can more easily do business with government through procurement reform.

3. The region's local government bodies should commit to allocating a finite set of resources to support civic innovation activities. Such resources might include:

	* Financial resources to establish and support a regional civic innovation fund;

	* Staff support to carry out special projects within interagency and multi-sector delivery teams;

	* Physical space to support experimentation;

	* Knowledge sharing about opportunities to reduce costs and improve outcomes in the delivery of public services; and,

	* Opportunities for the public to solve community problems in partnership with government.

### Future Considerations

Actions for future consideration by the advisory body, along with state and local agencies, include:

* Develop and adopt a regional approach to publishing open data;

* Create an entrepreneurs-in-residence program that would bring entrepreneurs into government who would propose, develop, and deploy solutions to reduce costs, improve outcomes, and boost local economic development;

* Develop initiatives to facilitate ethnography, user research, and usability testing to improve citizen-government interaction;

* Explore opportunities to build open application programming interfaces (APIs) that reduce the number of interagency friction points, including those between the state-local relationship;

* Encourage the state to create an advisory body that would explore the state's role in supporting civic innovation at the state-level;

* Adopt design principles to guide the development of interfaces to government and service delivery;

* Create positions in government that require skill sets from the new economy such as user experience,  visual design, and product management;

* Build capacity for the pursuit of side projects by public servants that have the potential to reduce costs and improve outcomes;

* Identify the role of universities in supporting regional civic innovation;

* Create a marketplace for government to post problems and citizens to propose cost-effective solutions; and,

* Fundamentally redesign the public meeting experience and recommend changes to state law in areas that would otherwise prevent the vision from being fully realized.
