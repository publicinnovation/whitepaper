Bridging Distant Worlds: Innovation in the Civic Space
==========

This purpose of this white paper is to set the context for and articulate a Regional Civic Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Agenda for the Greater Sacramento Metropolitan Area, comprising the [Sacramento Area Council of Government's jurisdiction](http://www.sacog.org/about/). 

A few things make this different:

1. We're crowdsourcing this content, including specific policy recommendations.
2. We're not a special interest group; we're just trying to move the needle on measurable quality of life outcomes.
3. We're open source, so please fork our policy and make it better.
