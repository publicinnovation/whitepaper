The following [Framework for an Innovative Jurisdiction](http://www.ash.harvard.edu/ash/Home/Programs/Innovations-in-Government/Publications/Journal-Articles-Occasional-Papers) was developed by the [Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation](http://www.ash.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. We provide the framework as a reference point for policymakers and stakeholders who wish to gain a broader view from the perspective of academia. In particular, Part 3 offers a [set of performance measures for evaluating civic innovation initiatives](http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/showdoc.html?id=3042090).
